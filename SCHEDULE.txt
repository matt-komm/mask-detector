Plannig for the Tracking:

1- Define Detector Geometry:

1.1 Cylindrical shape with multiple layers
TODO: fix geometry - define meaningful sizes (radii & coverage in eta)
TODO: endcap - is it needed? fix detector construction with endcap

1.2 Define un-sensitive area
DONE!

1.3 The tracker is a Silicon Tracker
TODO: do we need to refine the used material? what about electronics?

1.4 Constant Magnetic field
DONE! 

2- Hits and Hit collections
TODO: merge the hit collections from all layers

2.1 Position and Energy deposit
DONE!

2.2 Digitalization
TODO: conversion of SimHits into RecHits through smearing of position

3- Tracking Algo.
TODO: need mechanism to run modular analysis code

3.1 Trajectory Seeds
3.2 Track Building (pattern recognition, road search)
3.3 Final Fit
